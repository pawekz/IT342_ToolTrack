# ToolTrack

## Product Description

**ToolTrack: Smart Solutions for Seamless Tool Management** is a user-friendly app developed to track tool borrowing and returns. Both the web and mobile platforms make it easy for users to check tool availability, borrowing history, and maintenance schedules.

The system provides safe access to users through login and biometric authentication. It allows users to scan QR codes to easily find and verify tool details. Features such as borrowing requests, return processing, and notifications keep things running smoothly and keep users informed.

ToolTrack also provides analytics on how tools are being used and helps in scheduling maintenance and reservations. The system, therefore, makes tool management easier for organizations, saving them time, improving accountability, and keeping resources well-managed.
